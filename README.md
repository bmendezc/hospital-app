# Hospital Management App

This mock business will follow the general structure of a hospital, although a simplified version for the purposes of the project. This hospital will have patients that it provides healthcare services to, along with staff (employees, nurses, etc.), different healthcare departments and appointments that the patients can schedule, as well as transaction data associated with those appointments.

It is vital for a hospital to keep clear records of the services they have provided and of patient records so they can provide optimized, safe, and regulated care. Failure to meet standards of healthcare services could result in putting a patient’s life at risk.
